- The project is implemented with DDD design pattern (https://programmingpercy.tech/blog/how-to-domain-driven-design-ddd-golang/)

- Tests are all unit tests. If i should continue this project, the next step will be implementing integration tests and e2e tests. I am follower of the google theory of: 80% Unit tests, 15% Integration tests and 5% e2e tests.

- Static part is served file by a file server, having completely separated the frontend from the backend, as it was requested
